# Witness

Witnesses are entities that package and generate new blocks for the blockchain. Each witness is approved by shareholders, packages verified transactions, and generates and signs blocks. Every transaction that enters the network will eventually be verified by all witnesses.

## Consensus Mechanism

Who blocks and when is determined by a consensus algorithm called *Delegated Proof of Stak (DPOS)*. The essence of the algorithm is that META1 shareholders can vote to determine their desired block packer. Blocks are packaged and generated by the so-called "witnesses" who get the most votes.
