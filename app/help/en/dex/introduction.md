# Decentralized Exchange

The decentralized exchange (further denoted simply as *the DEX*) allows for
direct exchange of digital goods traded in the META1 ecosystem.

A decentralized exchange has a very particular set of advantages over
traditional centralized exchanges and we would like to address some of them
briefly below. Although the META1 DEX comes with all of them, it is up to
the reader and customer to leverage those features in full or only partially.

* **Separation of Powers**: 
  There is no reason why the same entity needs to be responsible for
  issuing IOUs and for processing the order book. In META1, order matching
  is performed by the protocol, which is unaware of implications concerning the
  involved assets.
  
* **Global Unified Order Book**:
  Since META1 is global, anybody with an internet access can use the DEX for
  trading. This brings the world's liquidity to a single order book for
  decentralized trading.
  
* **Trade Almost Anything**:
  The META1 DEX is asset agnostic. Hence you can trade at **any** pair.
  While some pairs may end up with low liquidity, such as SILVER:GOLD, other
  pairs such as XUSD:EUR for FOREX trading will see huge volume.
  
* **No Limits**:
  The META1 protocol is unable to limit your trading experience.
  
* **Decentralized**:
  The DEX is decentralized across the globe. This not only means that there is
  no single point of failure, but it also implies that the META1 exchange is
  open for trading 24/7 because it's always daytime somewhere.
  
* **Secure**:
  Your funds and trades are secured with industry-grade elliptic curve
  cryptography. No one will be able to access your funds unless you let them. To
  further strengthen the security, we allow our customers to setup escrow and
  multi-signature schemes.
  
* **Fast**:
  In contrast to other decentralized networks, the META1 DEX allows for
  real-time trading and is only limited by the speed of light and the size of
  the planet.
  
* **Provable Order Matching Algorithm**:
  What makes the META1 DEX unique is the provable order matching algorithm.
  Given a set of orders, you will always be able to provably verify that these
  orders have been matched properly.
